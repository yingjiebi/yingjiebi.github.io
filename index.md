# About

I received my B.S. in Microelectronics from Peking University in 2014 and my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University in 2020. My research interests include nonconvex optimization, machine learning, computer networks and control theory. Here is a link to my [CV](assets/cv-yingjie-bi.pdf).
